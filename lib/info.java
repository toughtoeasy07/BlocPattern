BlocPattern

This design pattern helps to separate presentation from business logic.


MapEventToState is a method that must be implemented when a class extends Bloc.
it take incoming event as an argument. mapEventToState is called whenever an event is dispatched by
 the presentation layer.
 mapEventToState  convert  event into a new state and return the new state in the form of a Stream



In other words mixins are normal classes from which we can borrow methods(or variables) from without extending the class.
 In dart we can do this by using the keyword
